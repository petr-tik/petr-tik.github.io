Just wanted to summarise my TILs from doing HackerRank problems up to now.

The most important skill is to remember the implemented solution and how you turned the problem into something solvable by your algorithm. When you are dealing with weighted edges, but know that a breadth-first search is neccessary (test for bipartiteness)
