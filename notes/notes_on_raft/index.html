<p>Below are my notes from watching Martin Thompson&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFfLCGW%5F5-w">talk on Cluster consensus in Aeron</a>.</p>

<h2 id="raft-a-consensus-algorithm">Raft - a consensus algorithm</h2>

<h3 id="most-fitting-definition-of-consensus">Most fitting definition of consensus</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>the judgement agreed on by the majority</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consensus can apply to a single value or shared state made of different primitives.</p>

<h3 id="prior-work-paxos">Prior work - Paxos</h3>

<p>Consensus algorithms were an active research topic in the 1970s and 1980s and
Paxos was one of the early ones.</p>

<p>However, the implementation complexity has let Paxos down and made it hard to use.</p>

<h3 id="what-problem-is-raft-solving">What problem is Raft solving</h3>

<p>Raft is a consensus algorithm that optimises for human understanding and ease of
implementation.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>

<p>Raft makes the implementation easy to follow by minimising the state space as much as possible and sticking to a few key principles.</p>

<h4 id="principles">Principles</h4>

<ul>
<li>Monotonically increasing time divided into terms: every term starts
with an election. Elections can either results in a new leader for this
term or undecided, in which case a new term starts with another election.</li>
<li>Randomisation settles conflicts.
Followers have a random timeout. If they don&rsquo;t receive an AppendEntries RPC
from their leader after this time out, they assume that the king/leader
is dead (long live the leader), they randomly decide to throw in the ring and become candidates for
this election.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="roles">Roles</h4>

<p>There are only 3 roles and transitions between them can be represented by this finite state machine.</p>

<p></div></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Follower</p>

<p>Every node starts as a follower. Followers are passive and issue no requests,
they can only serve the requests of others: candidates or the current leader.</p></li>

<li><p>Candidate</p>

<p>A node that wants to become leader in this term/election cycle. Sends the
RequestVote RPC to followers with its current state.</p></li>

<li><p>Leader</p>

<p>The only node that can send AppendEntries requests to other nodes. Is in
charge of dealing with requests from the client and passing them to
followers.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="rpc">RPC</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>RequestVote</p>

<p>Candidates get on the campaign trail by asking followers to back them.
Instead of hosting debates, this election is settled by checking if the
candidate &ldquo;knows more&rdquo; i.e. is further ahead in its state than the
follower that receives the request.</p>

<p>When a follower receives a RequestVote it compares its state with that of
the candidate and sends a positive vote if the candidate is further ahead
in its state.</p>

<p>This ensures that no candidate that is behind in terms is elected to be leader.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the crucial differences between Paxos and Raft. Paxos allows
electing a leader that is behind in its state. After electing such a leader,
they need to catch up/replay the state from their followers. This removes the
monotonic principle and increases implementation complexity by needing more RPC
types.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>AppendEntries</p>

<p>After successfully winning an election, the leader uses the same RPC to
replicate his state and heartbeat with all other nodes.</p>

<p>If there are no entries to append, this RPC serves as a heartbeat. In
case, there are new entries, the leader sends it out to all its followers.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<ul>
<li>Using Raft enables aeron to focus on &ldquo;Guaranteed Processing&rdquo; of messages
instead of &ldquo;Guaranteed Delivery&rdquo;. If processing is idempotent, delivering
the same message twice doesn&rsquo;t change system state.</li>
<li>Dynamically changing the state of the system - adding new nodes or hot
upgrades to currently running nodes.</li>
<li>State machine replication for event-sourced systems. Once the leader
sequences messages from the outside world, we can do a Gaddafi without
losing system state.</li>
</ul>
