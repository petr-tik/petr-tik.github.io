In 2022, I read [[https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=ISBN%3A+9780691170817&ia=web][The Box]] - a book about the invention and standardization of the shipping container.

I think some approaches and organisational principles carry over from the shipping industry into software development.

Below are snippets from the book and my comments.

But after years behind the wheel themselves, the McLeans understood that the easiest way to control costs was to get employees involved. Holding down insurance and repair bills. for example, meant having safety-conscious drivers. Novices were trained by being paired with senior drivers on the run from Winston-Salem to Atlanta. The senior driver got a bonus of one month's pay if a man he had trained made it through his first year without an accident. The incentives were powerful: the veteran had a strong financial incentive to train the newcomer well, and the new driver understood that he had best drive very carefully if he wanted to stick around.

Formal mentoring with an explicitly rewarded set of behaviours, where result can be objectively measured. Curious if any technology companies assess the quality of mentorship by measuring the performance of the mentee on the job.

Malcom McLean's fundamental insight, commonplace today but quite radical in the 1950s, was that the shipping industry's business was moving cargo, not sailing ships. That insight led him to a concept ot containerization quite different from anything that had come before.
McLean understood that reducing the cost of shipping goods required not just a metal box but an entirely new way or handling freight.
#+end_quote

Your customer cares about moving solving their problems i.e. moving their cargo, not your ability to sail ships. The public interface of a shipping company is "move my cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible from A to B". Once you offer that service to your users, you are free to implement the solution the way you see fit - invent containers, rebuild port infrastructure to load and unload them, change your ships from breakbulk into container shipping. If you become successful some of your implementation detail will inevitably leak out - people made base their decisions based on what they know about your service.

Weldon's research department pursued its quest for optimality by investigating the most efficient way to use Matson's fleet. Renting time on an IBM 704 computer at several hundred dollars a minute, the researchers built a fully fledged simulation model of the business, incorporating data on volume and costs for more than three hundred commodities at every port the company served at every time of year. Then they added in data on port labor costs, the current utilization of docks and cranes, and the load aboard each ship, to provide real-time answers to practical questions:

+ Should a big Hawaii-bound ship call at Hilo and Lanai, or should it transfer its cargo to a feeder ship at Honolulu?

+ What time of day should a vessel depart Honolulu so as to minimize total costs of delivering a load of pineapples to Oakland?

Where there is a will to implement data-driven decision making, there is a way, even if it costs *hundreds of dollars a minute*. The company committed resources to rent "cloud computers" to get insights that can increase its revenue. Simulated novel situations when they didn’t have data. Similarly to trading firms spending millions to investigate new trading strategies or FAANG companies training neural networks to optimise MAUs/other metrics.

They were just recruiting ... Many were invited to Newark without being told what job McLean had in mind for them. When they arrived, they were given intelligence and personality tests - a rare practice in the 1950s. McLean wanted people who were smart, aggressive, and entrepreneurial, the wrong test scores meant no job offer. Education did not matter;
#+end_quote

Hired for brains with an equal opportunity test regardless of one's educational background. Assessed culture fit with a personality test. While technical aptitude remains a uniformly administered interview round these days, culture fit is less explicit.


#+begin_quote
although Malcom McLean had a box at the Metropolitan Opera, intellectual airs were frowned upon, and new hires were advised to fracture their grammar to fit in with a crowd of truckers. "When we had nothing else to do, we would stand and pitch pennies," remenbered naval architect Charles Cushing, an MIT graduate who joined the company in 1960. "They don't teach you to pitch pennies at the Wharton School.»
#+end_quote

Know Your Customer and fit in. Employees were explicitly told to "culture fit" with their customers - truckers.

The work was seven days a week, in an exciting, demanding environment. Memos were not wanted. Conflict among executives was a given; managers were expected to meet, thrash out their differences, and act. Performance was measured constantly, and rewarded not with cash but with stock in the fast-growing company.
#+end_quote

Hire good people, create a culture of healthy debate, reward with stock to align incentives to make sure people disagree and commit instead of endlessly play politics.

Above all, he kept his eye on the money. Teletypes clattered constantly as outlying terminals sent booking information to headquarters. Clerks updated records showing how many days each container had carried revenue traffic, how many tons it had hauled, how many dollars it had grossed. Geographic analysis documented the land transportation patterns of Sea-Land cargo.
Monthly financial reports revealed how much revenue Sea-Land received from each commodity shipped from Newark to Texas, reminding all that an eighteen-ton container of liquor was twice as profitable as a four-ton container of toys. Weekly reports documented cash flow.

And there was an endless stream of demands for better cost control. Shaving 1.6 cents off the cost of handling 100 pounds in Ponce could save $14,300 a year. One more container lift per gang hour would save $180,000.
Limiting long-distance telephone calls to three minutes would save $65,000. "Probably more attention was paid to financial results there than you find in any company around today," remembered Earl Hall, later Sea-Land's chief financial officer. In 1961, its sixth year, Sea-Land's container business had finally moved into the black. So long as McLean was involved in running it, Sea-Land never lost money again.

I've had business/product managers tell me that metrics are easy to game. Make revenue a metric and have your people game it. It's a nice game to win.

One of the ways to win at that game is to control one's expenditure by analysing costs and making small adjustments that aggregate into big savings overall.

McLean's hasty capital deprecation strategy must have put managers under more pressure to deliver in the short term and simultaneously ensured higher profits in the future.

They are turning this job into a factory job ... a sense of camraderie.

Made me mindful about the immediate impacts of automation. People used to their routine and derive a sense of purpose from belonging feel a sense of loss, even when automation removed the aspects of physical labour.

#+begin_quote
despite these discontents ...

It's possible to amicably resolve the next wave of industrial automation if the experience of longshoremen is taken into account.

Suboptimal uniformity sooner is better than allowing entropy. The formatting by gofmt isn't anyone's favourite, but it's better than 1000s of developers each developing their own style like C++.

One of the advantage of being an early adopter is the ability to steer standards that will last for decades if successful. Conversely, this shows that the short-term concerns of the standardization participants can have long-term repercussions.

End-to-end test your standard with real-world inputs. Having participated in fundamental library design, I have seen how important it is to integrate the new proposed API into an existing system and watch how it handles real traffic. I also expect the real-world to come up with unexpected use cases, which encourages me to seek contact with reality as early as possible.

I now question if people who romanticise about =the way things have always been= are just worried about progress.

Similar to the pre-SpaceX time of satellite and defence contracts in the US. NASA was a monopolist with no incentive to even try 10x improvements.

Their romanticism blinds them to the long-term effects and makes them bad predictors.

I think this was an accidental by-product of containerization, not an explicit use case taken into consideration when the shipping container and dock infrastructure were being designed. I suspect the biz dev types at the time realised that containers are qualitatively better at delivering cargo with minimal risk of theft and must have targeted companies whose goods were often stolen from breakbulk storage. Other types of products must have been:
+ canned food
+ fruit and vegetables
+ clothes
